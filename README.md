This is a simple **React.js** website that allows users to view workout plans and watch embedded YouTube videos. The app includes dropdown menus for different workout categories and a video section that lets users select and play videos. The interface features a toggleable image overlay and displays detailed workout plans based on user selection.

## Features
1. **Workout Dropdown**: Choose between "Arms," "Chest & Back," and "Legs" to display specific exercises, sets, and repetitions.
2. **Cinematics Dropdown**: Select from three different videos to play embedded YouTube videos.

5. **Workout Details**: Displays selected workout exercises with corresponding sets and reps.


## Future Improvements

2.Implement additional features like progress tracking or workout logs.
3.Customize the YouTube player to include videos the user wants to play

## Inspirations behind the project
Initial this project was an idea me and my friends thought of in highschool but never had the means to do it. So I took the intiative to fix it myself.
Nex the workout portion of this was an idea as of recent. I have a social media where I post fitness content and I was going to make this one of the websites my viewers could go to.
